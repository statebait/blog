But honestly, this has changed over the years as Windows has matured into what it is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article assumes you are using Windows 10, however since Windows offers a decent amount of
backwards compatibility, you should be able to pull this off with an older version of Windows too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Terminal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets get started with the terminal. The terminal will be extensively used as you will be using a wholesome of different CLIs (Command Line Interfaces, like npm). Primarily you should be using PowerShell and bash (I’ll get to this) with a wrapper like &lt;a href=&quot;https://hyper.is/&quot;&gt;hyper&lt;/a&gt;. Hyper is electron-based terminal built on HTML/CSS/JS. It has loads of extensions to add utility and themes to lavish your experience.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve mentioned the use of bash. Yes, you can install bash on windows and no it’s not a gimmick or some half-baked thing, its the real deal. Meet the Windows Subsystem for Linux (This feature was added to one of the later versions of Windows 10). &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is how to install it. You should use bash whenever PowerShell is giving you unheeded trouble. Remember that when you run bash, its a completely different OS running somewhere on your windows and therefore you need to make fresh installations of all your CLIs using the appropriate commands(depends on which Linux installation you choose).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Handy Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving on let’s install a command-line installer. This is quite handy for doing quick installs of different tools. The 2 most popular options on windows are &lt;a href=&quot;https://scoop.sh/&quot;&gt;Scoop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://chocolatey.org/&quot;&gt;Chocolatey&lt;/a&gt;. I personally prefer Scoop, because of its more minimal operation, but you couldn’t go wrong with either(installing both is also an option). These let you install things like Node, Python etc. in the blink of an eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we need to pick a good web package manager. Again the 2 most popular ones are npm and yarn. npm will be installed by default when you install Node.js. You can install yarn here. Yarn uses npm’s package repository, the only difference being is the way it handles dependencies and its performance (You can read more about the differences on its website). I personally use yarn, but you cannot go wrong with either. There is one more package manager which is not used anymore (but is maintained), but I think I’ll mention it anyway; bower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also having Git installed is kind of necessary as it serve as the backbone of most modern web projects and for that matter any development project 😜(&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/code-dementia/why-and-how-you-should-start-using-git-github-right-now-28617df72545&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a guide on Git and GitHub by Hemant Jain). Finally, you might come across a few errors due to missing build tools. These are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/windows-build-tools&quot;&gt;windows-build-tools&lt;/a&gt;, which are some modules necessary for compiling, running and building different stuff. While I’m not clear on exactly what modules this package contains, it has helped me avoid a lot of errors when I was trying out new stuff and is mandatory for a lot of different projects. You can simply install them by running:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; --global windows-build-tools&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, if you are using Yarn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;yarn&lt;/span&gt; global &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; windows-build-tools&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Code Editor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Code Editor is one of the most important things in web development and as a matter of fact in any kind of development (yes, I have a habit of repeating phrases). Having a seamless experience during coding, debugging can help with all the frustration that comes along with it. Personally, I have used a lot of different code editors, some that come loaded with a plethora of features and some that just have the bare minimum. However, there was only one that stuck; VS Code (abbr. for Visual Studio Code). VS Code comes with a handful features out of the box which should be enough to get you started and as you proceed you can explore its vast extensions marketplace to enhance your experience. VS Code with a good set of extensions can easily replicate a modern full-fledged IDE and all that with exceptional performance. Currently, its the most popular code editor for a lot of different categories of developers and receives new updates and features every month.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough VS Code, moving on we have other options like &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sublimetext.com/&quot;&gt;Sublime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brackets.io/&quot;&gt;Brackets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/&quot;&gt;WebStorm&lt;/a&gt; etc. Atom is very similar to VS Code but the place it lacks mainly is performance, as you load new extensions in Atom, it slows down significantly. WebStorm is an industry level IDE with all the important features out of the box but it is not free (unless you are a student enrolled in a school).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you could also use a Cloud IDE which basically are code editors running on the browsers. They come with a lot of handy features. Some of them are &lt;a href=&quot;https://codesandbox.io/&quot;&gt;Code Sandbox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gitpod.io/&quot;&gt;GitPod&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://coder.com/&quot;&gt;Coder&lt;/a&gt; etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;API Tester&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having an API Tester (for REST and GraphQL API’s)is really important as when you develop different API’s for your application in your back-end, the easiest way to test them are these. The 2 most popular ones are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.getpostman.com/&quot;&gt;Postman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://insomnia.rest/&quot;&gt;Insomnia&lt;/a&gt;, the latter also has GraphQL support. I personally use Insomnia due to its easier to use interface and the free themes available. Postman on the other hands has a lot of different team features which are helpful when you are working on large projects with larger teams. You couldn’t go wrong with either of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;UI/UX Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you like it or not, User Interfaces and User experiences are an integral part of web development. When developing the front-end of any web project it some times it helps a lot to start with creating mockups &amp;#x26; prototypes of the interface. Some easy (and free) to use tools for this are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.figma.com/&quot;&gt;Figma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adobe.com/in/products/xd.html&quot;&gt;Adobe XD&lt;/a&gt;. I prefer using Figma, mainly because it has an option to easily export the CSS of any object created. Other than that you couldn’t go wrong with either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing the Web on Windows has never been as easy as it is today, so let go of the myth that only Mac’s and Linux PC’s can do it and start developing on Windows today. 😃&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mistakes I Made in My First React App]]></title><description><![CDATA[I decided to write this article for all the people starting out with new React projects, in hope that it helps them in some way.

Why React? Its pretty simple, at this point in my life I was just stepping into the cosmos of Web, and React was the most popular front-end framework.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app I built is used for the Elections of the Student Body Government in my College and it took me approximately 2 months to complete it. Link to the GitHub repository: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shadxx7/elections-frontend&quot;&gt;https://github.com/shadxx7/elections-frontend&lt;/a&gt;. So let’s begin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;State Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve learned React enough and for that matter any good JS front-end framework, you would know the importance of state management. Good state management is key to a scalable and flexible application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;React allows you to use different state managing libraries, the most popular being Redux and as expected I also used it in this project but let me be clear, &lt;strong&gt;Redux is not always the answer&lt;/strong&gt;. Now don’t get me wrong, Redux is great, but &lt;em&gt;yes the infamous but&lt;/em&gt; its not meant for all projects. Redux, as it defines itself, is a “Predictable State Container”, which basically means that it enables you to maintain a global state throughout your React app and you can plug this state into any component you wish. All sounding great? The problem comes in when you realize the amount of overhead code you need to write to achieve this. Some would argue that what is the problem? The problem is that sometimes its just not necessary to maintain a global state and this, of course, varies with your use case, but I can’t tell how much time I would have saved if I decided to do things differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So conclusion; don’t use Redux? No, its more like before deciding on a state library, its better to assess the needs of the app, study the different libraries like MobX or maybe even use React Context API and then finalize on what you want to use and where.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing, this single word is able to spring hateful emotions in millions of developers around the world. However you feel, I made the terrible mistake of avoiding it until I finished most of the application. At first, it never seems apparent to write tests for every little UI/function you add in your application, but when you are finalizing your application and need to perform full tests, it is painful to do them manually and also humanly impossible to cover all the different test cases, especially when it comes to UI testing. This is when you realize writing tests alongside writing your components comes in really handy. Currently, to write my tests, I’m using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro&quot;&gt;react-testing-library&lt;/a&gt; and I found it great so far. Other libraries also exist, like Airbnb’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://airbnb.io/enzyme/&quot;&gt;enzyme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Class and Functional Components&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When starting out in React, everyone usually prefers class components over functional ones. I
initially also used class components everywhere. Then again, it only makes sense to, as React
life-cycle methods are only available to class components (this is assuming Hooks haven’t released),
but the use of functional components is very important. This is because they are just faster in terms
of performance as compared to class components. They can make quite the difference when your pages
get component heavy and additionally they look more cleaner in terms of code, hence increasing code
readability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nitty-gritties&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now with the smaller problems and mistakes;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;a. Trying to render empty functions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mistake wasted hours of my life. Basically, when you try to render a class function like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;renderFields&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; currentCommittee &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;props&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;poll&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;currentCommittee&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;currrentCommittee&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

render &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
              &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;renderFields&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will return an error if the props haven’t loaded on the first render, meaning that if you are loading props with any kind of delay (for example — from your back-end) the above code, breaks. The quick fix for this is to use the lodash library’s ‘get’ function and make a quick check if the prop has loaded or not, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;render &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;_&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;currentCommittee&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;candidates&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;renderFields&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;b. Folder structure and Naming Scheme&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s necessary to have a good folder structure but wasting too much time on it is unnecessary. Simply deciding on the popular choices and then tweaking it a little according to your needs should do the job. The one I finally followed was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;txt&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-txt&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-txt&quot;&gt;/src
  /assets
  /components
  /store
  /style
  /tests
/utils&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;/assets for images, icons etc. /components for all my components, /store for my Redux store and actions, /style for all css files, /tests for all the tests and /utils for some extra utility function files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend not to put css files in an independent style folder, instead just drop them in their respective component folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For naming component files and folders, I initially followed the Snake case (hello_world) naming method owing to the redundant python projects I’ve done. The problem in using this naming scheme in React projects is that it doesn’t sit well with the strict Pascal case (HelloWorld) used in naming React components in JSX. Therefore to avoid further confusion and to satisfy my OCD, I switched back all my component files and folders to Pascal case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;c. Using Modern React&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;React is being frequently updated with new features and improvements and this shouldn’t be news as it is currently the most popular JavaScript front-end framework. Although the core React team rarely introduces breaking changes, its imperative to keep up with the newest changes as to have the best performing applications. On just the course of this project, there were over 10 releases of React. At this point in time, what I would call modern React would be the React Context API, React Suspense, React Hooks, React Concurrent etc. Primarily, I felt that I could’ve used the React Context API to replace most of the Redux I’ve used which would have saved a lot of my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;d. Should’ve used Typescript? Maybe.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, at the time of writing this article, I’ve already learnt typescript and I see it’s importance clearly. There isn’t too much I can explain directly from the project, but here’s what I have to say; Typescript definitely helps a lot especially with larger projects. Yes, it does add a little bit of overhead code but writing that extra code is what you’ll prefer over a stream of errors related to types on which you’ll waste hours debugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are these all the mistakes I made? No, of course not, there were many others, but I don’t think they are worth mentioning, mostly because they were either caused by my stupidity or were unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
